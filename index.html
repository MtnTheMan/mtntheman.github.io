            <p>I am driven by a vision of natural resource stewardship that bridges rigorous science with community-centered practice. My ambition is to foster resilient landscapes by integrating high-resolution spatial analysis, stakeholder engagement, and policy insight into forest and agroforestry management. I approach every project as a systems thinker, seeking to understand how ecological patterns interact with human values. By emphasizing applied research and inclusive collaboration, I aim to inform decision-making processes that support sustainable resource use across diverse landscapes.

            
            Since joining Michigan State University’s Human Dimensions of Natural Resources Lab in Summer 2023, I have been led on an expansive agroforestry research initiative across the Great Lakes states. Drawing on advanced machine learning and GIS methods, I developed an ultra-high-resolution land cover map for Michigan that underpins precision conservation across 68 counties. Building on this foundation, I designed a new riparian buffer index and have presented findings at national forums, including the Society of American Foresters conference. Collaborating with the U.S. Forest Service, Ohio State University, and the University of Wisconsin–Madison, I have examined how individual landowner choices shape agroforestry adoption—and my five-chapter master’s thesis on this topic successfully defended in March 2025.

            
            Prior to MSU, I held forestry technician and natural resource specialist roles with the U.S. Forest Service and National Park Service, where I managed over 400 miles of trails, developed recreation infrastructure, and coordinated citizen science integration across park units. At NOAA’s Halocarbons and Trace Species group, I built airborne sampling tools and analyzed greenhouse gas distributions. During legislative internships in Washington, D.C. and Denver, I researched environmental policy, drafted briefs for congressional representatives, and honed my ability to navigate complex regulatory environments. Through these experiences, I cultivated expertise in stakeholder outreach, data-driven decision making, and collaborative leadership.

            
            I hold a B.A. in Environmental Studies (magna cum laude) and Atmospheric/Oceanic Sciences from the University of Colorado at Boulder, where my honors thesis on citizen science informed early detection of invasive species. At MSU, I have maintained a 4.0 GPA, served as president of the Forestry Graduate Student Organization, and contributed to interdisciplinary work on wildfire preparedness in the western U.S. I look forward to continuing my professional journey by pursuing doctoral research focused on mapping timber management strategies across North American hardwood forests. Welcome to my website—please explore my projects, publications, and opportunities for collaboration as I work to advance sustainable natural resource management.
